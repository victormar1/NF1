# NF1 Method for Sequencing 

Whole genome sequencing was performed following the recommendations of “France Médecine Génomique 2025” Plan. Genomic DNA extracted from whole blood was sequenced according to standard procedures for a Polymerase Chain Reaction-Free genome on a NovaSeq6000 instrument (Illumina, San Diego, California, USA). Sequencing data were aligned to the GRCh38p13 full assembly using bwa 0.7+. Variants were called by several algorithms including GATK4+, Bcftools1.10+, Manta1.6+, CNVnator0.4+, and annotated using the variant effect predictor. Detected variants were prioritized using in-house procedures. Further details are available on request on http://www.auragen.fr.
